# User@Issue

A user-issue is relative to the project, but relative to the user’s fork.

GitHub’s usernames can contain alphabetical characters and dashes, but can neither begin nor end with a dash. Additionally, the length of a username can be between 1 and 39 characters (both including).

-   This is a valid issue: wooorm#1;
-   So is this: wooorm#123456789.

They work here
wooorm#1

and here
    wooorm#1

This is not a valid, -wooorm#1; nor is this wooorm-#1; but this is w-w#1, and so is w#1 and ww#1.

This is too long: wooormwooormwooormwooormwooormwooormwooo#1 (40 character username).
