# User@Project

A project-SHA is not relative to the current project.

GitHubâ€™s project names can include alphabetical characters, dashes, and full-stops. They may end in a TLD (such as `.com`), but may not end in `.git` (for obvious reasons).

-   This is a valid issue: wooorm/remark#1;
-   So is this: wooorm/remark#123456789.

They work here
wooorm/remark#1

and here
    wooorm/remark#1

Usernames: this is not a valid, -wooorm/remark#1; nor is this wooorm-/remark#1; but this is w-w/remark#1, and so is w/remark#1 and ww/remark#1.

Project names: this is not a valid, wooorm/c.git#1; but this is wooorm/c#1, so is w/w#1, and ww/.gitconfig#1.

This is too long: wooormwooormwooormwooormwooormwooormwooo/c#1 (40 character username).
