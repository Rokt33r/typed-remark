# Mention

A mention links to a user, organisation, or team.

For example, @user, @organization, or @organization/team-name.

Additionally, GitHub does something funny with @mentionâ€™s and @mentions.

Some valid real world examples: @a, @github, @github/security.

But these names are invalid: @-w, @w-, but this is: @w-w.
