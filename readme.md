# Typed Remark

A fork of Remark markdown processor, written in Typescript!

## Why did you fork remark?

I like Remark processor. But, after starting using Typescript, I found there are
tons of type definitions are needed for Remark and its tons of dependencies.
But, I don't understand this markdown processor deeply. So, rather than making
type definitions, I choose rewritting whole dependencies in Typescript.

## What we are doing

- Use typescript
- Use ES NEXT(`import`, `let`, `const`... and lots of good things)
- Discard unnecessary assertion
- Discard polymorphism if possible
- Rename vague variable and function names
