# Typed Remark

A fork of Remark markdown processor, written in Typescript!

## Packages

- VFile
- Unified

## Why?

I really like [Remark] package. It is really well written and maintained.

But, after I started using typescript, I found there is no type definition of it and its APIs are hard to be defined because they have tons of various way to use.

So, this package is some kind of a suggestion for [wooorm(Author)][wooorm] to use Typescript.

Use at caution. This package's truck factor is **ONE**.

As long as, I can afford, I'm going to keep following updates of original remark package.
